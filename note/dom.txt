        -if we want to store it in a variable

            var banner = document.getElementById('page-banner');

3.JavaScript DOM Tutorial #3 - Get Elements By Class or Tag

    -select by tag

        var lis = document.getElementsByTagName('li');

    -select by class name

        var titles = document.getElementsByClassName('title');

    -we get elements by tag name or class name we get those as a collection

      not as an array.so we can not traverse them .

     -Check array or not

        Array.isArray(titles);

     -convert collection in to array

        Array.form(titles);

     -normally any collection can be traverse by for loop but not with forEach.

     have to be a array to traverse with forEach
